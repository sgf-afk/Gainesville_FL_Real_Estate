# Gainesville_FL_Real_Estate
Machine learning models designed to predict real estate values in Gainesville, FL.

Sourced from the local MLS database. Any property that is listed with an agent is loaded into the MLS database and has additional information provided by the listing agent. Since the data is a paid for subscription, the base csv file is hosted locally, but my notebook is shared here.
