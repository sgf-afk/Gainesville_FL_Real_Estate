# Linear Regression Analysis
Machine learning models designed to predict real estate values in Gainesville, FL.

Primarily utilizing linear regression for easy interpretability, I analyzed two years worth of home sales data. The most accurate modeling was achieved after regularization using LassoCV. From that model I generated coefficient ratings to further understand what physical features of a house helps drive sales price.

Note: Sourced from the local MLS database. Any property that is listed with an agent is loaded into the MLS database and has additional information provided by the listing agent. Since the data is a paid for subscription, the base csv file is hosted locally, but my notebook is shared here.
