# Gainesville_FL_Real_Estate
Machine learning models designed to predict real estate values in Gainesville, FL.

Sourced from the local MLS database and the property appraiser database. Any property that is listed with an agent is loaded into the MLS database and has additional information provided by the listing agent. Not every property that is sold is listed with an agent, hence the inclusion of the county property appraiser sales records which are records obtained by the county government for every sale processed.
